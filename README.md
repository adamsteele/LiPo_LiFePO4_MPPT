LiPo LiFePO4 MPPT
=================

This is a basic MPPT charger currently setup to do 3S LiPo batteries based on the LT3652 chip.

This is mostly a copy of this http://www.mictronics.de/projects/solar-cell-mppt/ project. It just didn't have nice eagle schematics or a completed BOM.

I've built and tested this board and it mostly works. What didn't work for me are the status LEDs, I haven't figured out why.

The board should be stackable to provide a higher current rating, but I haven't tested it. Linear Electronics has some app notes on the subject that I recommend reading. The stackable boards don't need to be fully populated.
